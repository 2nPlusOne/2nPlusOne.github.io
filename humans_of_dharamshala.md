## Humans of Dharamshala
While studying in Dharamshala, India, I volunteered with Hope Gallery/Wild Yak Studios in McCloud Ganj to help with their "Humans of Dharamshala" project. The goal of the project is to explore the unique city of Dharamshala and feature the stories and portraits of those who call it home.
