## Vijay - Shoe Doctor

“I was 12 when I left Rajasthan to live in Dharamshala. I miss my friends.
I have a big sister and one brother. My brother has no eyes, born that way. I stay with my brother, wife, and three children here, in lower Dharamshala.
My brother is in my home in lower Dharamshala. Doctors say maybe an operation, but he says 25,000 rupees. But because… you know… I have a family - I have a daughter, two sons - not everything is possible.
This spot costs rent from me. One day is 280 rupees. Off season is not good business for me. During season, sometimes I make 500-600 rupees. During off season, sometimes 20 rupees, sometimes 100 or 200. If I want, I close. If my brother has some problem, I close, and I go home.
I have 5 friends, very very near my heart. One girl, I miss her. Another friend, sometimes he meets me. He is in Rajasthan. Sometimes I go there, so I meet him.”
